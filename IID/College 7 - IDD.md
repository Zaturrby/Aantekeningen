DJPsych. Trumanshow. Nessecary show to skillfully navigate the media. Narcissimn and paranoia mixed with awareness of media. Often literary referencing the Truman show. The people closest in your life are acting. Im supoosed to do something, but I dont know what is is. You;'re the one. But what you don't know. Everyone is following you. 

In psychiatry you will leave it at that. Paranoia kan be helped. But the cultural context can help to 'treat' people. There are 3 kenmerken:
 
1. The ordinary is changed or different and that there is particular significane in this.
2. The is coupled with a searching for meaning
3. Porfound alteration of subjective experience and of self-awareness. resulting in an unstable firstperson perspective with varieties of depersonaliszation and derealization. Distubered sense of ownership. 

There is a general sense that optimism are delusions, also pessimism. But sometimes these are useless. Its a helpfull delusion? Given that we live in media. Could the Truman show help us. That everything is constantly changing, and things are being edited as we interact with it? It might help to accept that media is there, and play with it. 

## Pauze

What is similar and what is different. They hit similar points though. Kittler. Gramaphone, Film, Typewriter. Kittlers wanted to look at three technologies that kindoff disappearing. Kittler is a media-archeologist. These signal the major transformation of signing and personal performance. These media got major lashback from sheetmusic, the previous was they communicated. The media changed to something very different. 

One of the things that is a little bit more complicated it the typewriter. This is one device that actually increased production. The direction for ear to finger got do without eyes. Everyone types now, previously that was very little. But you phd had to be typed. It was practised mostly by women, they were a form of automatisation. That changed radically when we got the laptop. Its not anymore a keybord, but an interactive device. 

Telephone, grammaphone. The grammophone grew out of the telephone. There were three gold medals handed out for three different people for the phone. Bell, Edison, and an Englishman.  Edison also got a phonograph. A recording device for the telephone. Deeply linked. They are also linked in anohter way. 

There is another device that changed a lot. They allowed for a person to manange their media-experience to a degree. Records and films are still institutionally produced, but you can interact with them locally. Even though the telephone didnt have a lot of units being sold. It was the first ubiquitous media. Everywhere you had a trainline you had a phoneline. Telegraph was run next to the trainline. The trainmap is a good map of teleocmmunication. 

You get a proliferation of lines across the globe. Even then there where lines running over the ocean. The is the foundation of ubiquity. This is also changed by wifi again. The problem before was though being pervasive, nearly ubiquitous. transformed how people communicated. But it was very very expensive. Only on special occasions people had acces to communication. 

There where also portale media. These started to really proliferate in the 6oties. The were gendered, probably more in media that in practice. You spend alot of time talking your friends talking about music. Entertainment. Localising everything even in a distance. It has its genenis here. 

The phonograph killed of the sheetmusic and  ... . It made us all local. Distance is local. This is different that film and similar media. These could be directed. Even television didnot change this. It was institutionally directed. The telephone changed this. Today this has been hyperextension of this model, build on the backbone of that other platform. The institutionalised infrastucture is still there. But they allow us to chose how to work with them. The control over what you engage with, when, is new. Television is also breaking in the last years. That ability for us to become curators of own entertainment has been hyperextented. Its not just for consuption (though we all pay for it one way or another). 

Its all breaking down to convergence. Convergence into a single instrument allow for all these different media. There is no grand trajectory. The people who make this stuff live in the same area as the people who made the other stuff. Silicon Valley. The music industry was ready for this too. It wasn't a mistake. Broadcast took a little longer. TV is letting it go more and more. 

But its also about scale. The platfom that is growing is mobile. This doenst include grey technologies. 75% This vast proliferation which is new. 

The cloud. Because we're all connection. It's connection so many people, we dont have to follow the model of local storage. Everything exists digitally. You voice was never stored with the phone, the phonograph for that. But that needed intervention. Now its stored. Everything is digitally mediated. The cloud is a logical extention of the internet. Everything is connected. Physical objects being stored. 

Why not let store everything online? Why not is a good question. Because then we know everything you're doing. Unless you have a record collection of 14.500 thousand records is difficult, now its easy. You can just hack into a machine and download it. They can constantly look at what you're doing. Gdrive, Icloud, AWS. Which is the point.

The pace of performance is slow. Today it fast. Previously it was slow. The narretive took alot longer. This practice of making local, extending the local, localising everything to your own choices. It extends to what that collects information. But it lives somewhere else and locally. You don't just talk, watch or listen on a phone. The Iphone 6 has a whole health package. There are sensors everywhere. We're getting sensored. 

Nest. Thermostat. New technology, a "smart" thermostat. We extend the metaforms. Inefficient storage in clouds is not smart. Which anticipates modes of working. It a two way training. We start imagining technologies before we can build them. we can do this now. This is actually not only monitoring your environment, but also your behavior, and tell alot of other people. They know a lot about you. It knows those things. It records them. This is being extented to other things. A small sample. 

Weve got microdrones, big drones, smart pavements. Being installed in Londen, Copenhagen. They generate energy, they also monitor, they could also monitor your phone. Smart streetlabs, smart cars, driverless car. Smart dust. Little tini tiny sensors. Militairy use. Extention of the Vietnames war. 

The Truman show. The NSA can watch you without using your camera. There are sensors everywhere and they are proliferating in a fast way. Spaza (first week) uses sensors too. 


## The internet of things.

It had a name a long time. IoT. The idea is that we are not only living in a world where everything is monitored. Everything is connected and working. But not everything is working. The seemless connectivity is a problem. Building the sensors is easy. Getting them to work together is hard. You can buy alot of "smart" things. They are all like Nest. But also then its monitoring. Monitored means it's public, you may not know or share, it is public. 

If there is value the problems get sorting out. Who can actually afford it. Do government see it as a threat? Or usefull. It looks simple though its difficult. We think of this being difficult. It's easy. What is difficult is the hidden work and especially what is the social value?! That is really hard! example is the semantic web. Adresses are a problem too. These things also assume a infrastructer. The US internet infrastructure is horrible. They cannot accommedate the request.  We're number 5. Korea is the first. The US has a rubish infrastucture. 

Carnabotnet. Its a bit of code. Internet census. It proliferated itself over the world looking for server en cellphone acces. The botnet got into a half a million cellphone, to see how much traffic is being done. Its easy while we assume its private. You can see very cleary the non-uniformity of internet. Almost all of the innovation in the internet is in the black area's. They have to be innovated. 

Other things get hacked too. iCloud. It shows that everything is public. But that social conventions and rules have not caught up. "Everything on some level should be public" Lucily this time people are not that condescending. We gotta have smoe level op privacy. Changing the tech is easy, but nobody does it. The web should be open on some level, but it also need to hide to some degree. Encryption, old tech.

About whom should be worried? Ashbury, greatfull death. Rise of the counterculture. Hippies. The seed. All the black kids went off to war, the white went to silicon valley. Whom should be more worried about. Governments of Corporations. Governments have been massively monitoring. Its not just the US. Even our our own government is doing it. Its illegal. They are legalising the illegal. Pervasiveness.

Its got two aspects. It's liberating, we have much greater control of our world. But there is this other side. It makes things more dangerous aswell. General Petreas said they can spy on everyone. 

Snowdens point is true. Its not just dystopianism. What about the health-insurance and health information. Luckily turning off stuff has to be denied in an other way. They know they are being watch. They are waving their phones being watched, but also because they can subvert that with technology. All these dystopian futures assume that were passive consumers. There are not many stupid people. We know this is going on. We know, if it matters, how to subvert it. We modify our behavior. You think harder of what you tweet dan what you say in a bar. Justifying yourself on twitter is hard though, you don't say it, or you don't say it that well. This is the hard part. 

It's not just Trueman. It worked because of extraordinairy structure. When did it started breaking down? When things start going wrong you noticed the underlying systems. People are good a creating choas, it helps. You see the hidden stuff that makes it seem seemless. We didn't see it in microsoft. Somebody there knows about it. 

What has it to do with ubiquity. There is not a term for ubiquity in Dutch. Pervasiveness and Ubiquity. Pervasive sees this a technological problem. Ubiquity sees it as a social cultural technological problem. That is why we use ubiquity. It is this strange space. Its new and different. Its playing on tradition, but it new, we never had this ability. 

It could be liberating, or constraining? Does it help? Doens't look like it for climate, we know more. Its a gamechanger. Its going to have a major impact. But its uncertain how it will play out. It changes how people interact with others and themself.

## Ubiquitous computing

Even convergence is different. Photography could record the word, extended to movement in film. It created whole new erformative possibilities. Television changed how film was localised. Ubiquitous computering is different. Walkman first portable music device. Convergence makes it look as these things are coalecing. But ubiquity is more about multiplication. Everything can coalece because its multipicated. It a combination of multiplication and ubiquity. 

## Finish up

Multiple Choice exam is much more fair. Next thurssday. Multiple choice exam. We've only drawn questions from the presentation. There are no trickquestion. Its in the readings or blackboard. Its about seeing about learing. 

Convergence is bringing things together. But that can only be done trough its multiplicity
