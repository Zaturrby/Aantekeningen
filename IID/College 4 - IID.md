## Recapitulation

Its very usefull to thing in patterns and interpretations. The interpretation can again be seen as data. 

## Patterns

But we did not really talk about the notion of pattern. Its very hard to find. A pattern is not neccecairy a graph. What is it accually? The way humans see patterns is neccecairy to survive. Without this you cannot survive. A kind of regularity that you see, but that is not resolute. If we talk about information we often talk about organised information.

What are patterns in the Humanities. The first question you might ask if patterns are graphs. Patterns are ubiquitous in the humanities. The way scientific research works is searching for patterns in nature, but the humanties prefer interpretation more hermeneutic. But the've always been searching for patterns. 

Beethoven. Beethoven became deaf during the last part of his live. They divide all beethoves works in 3 periodes. The very last period he becomes really romantic. There is regularity in his work. Art historians like Warburg have represent the wind in   hair. Patterns are not neccecairily quantative. Regularity or disregularity like the wind in a persons hair. 

The Republic of Letters is about whom wrote a letters to whom. The Republic of letters starts very early, people communicated by letters. Paris Amsterdam and Londen are quite connected. Brussels was there too. But you can see what the central cities in communication where. You can focus on verious people, historians like this very much. How where certain idea's exchanged. 

In linguistics the sound change laws from the Grimm. Shifts of of consonants. t -> th -> d. They wrote it down. They form a pattern in language. You can look back to sanskrit, all indo-european languages could have arisen from this. Current syntactical structures in literature are also looked for. 

Pattern. A pattern is a trend or tendency that can range from the local to the global. It can consist of a regularity, but also of a grammatical rule, or a historical trend. Some patterns may be similar to laws. It can be trends aswell as exacts laws. Its broad. It can be very erratic, but usally we need a trend.

Patterns can be found in all disciplines, periods and regions. It can be clear identification of patterns can be aided by digital techniques. You can induce patterns from enourmous ammounts of data. But the data needs to digitised in a searchable format. Digitalisation is essential to this. There are even patterns that can not be indentified without digital means. Two centuries are a long time. 

There is a difference between deep and shallow patterns. You cant see a syntactical structure in a text. Unlike the word order which is rather shallow. In paintings the composition is hierarchical, deep. Lines and colours are lineair and simple. Shallow. Usually the difference between shallow and deep is that its not directly visible. Complex patterns need predefined definitions, explicitness.

Some patterns are local, and others are claimed to be universial. Patterns in Beethoves work cannot be applied to others. And even if Grimm believed that his sound change laws where universal, they were only valid for indo germanic languages. Others are more universal, like the convex structure of musical scales. 

## Humanities

1.0 Was the hermeneutic and critical tradition as it was developed during the 19th century and early 20th.

2.0 Refers to the use of digital tools to humanties material: search for patters. There is something unsatisfactuary. If you do not interpret it, its rather boring.

3.0 Refers to the hermeneutic and critical tradition applied to patterns found and tools used. But 3.0 requires 2.0, you need to master the tools. You combine them both.

## Case studies



Patterns in textual repositories. You have to notions of patterns, flat and deep. Ngram viewer is rather flat.

What are textual repositories. Project Gutenburg is interesting,  much smaller than Google, just 45.000 books. Its open and voluntairy though. They are without errors unlike googles. You can also talk of KB Historical Newspapers. There are 9 million pages. You can do alot of research with it. There are a lot of patterns in there. 

If you want to do something with the texts and you only look for shallow patterns you cannot get everything out. In a single sentence there is a lot of syntactical structure. It becomes rather complex. You can divide at sentence in its constituant parts. You can do that recursively. Why is it interesting? 

Textual similairity. Often scientist wonder about where people get their inspiration from. There are alot of questions here. What is similairity? What is meaning? You cannot look at words only. You need to go to syntactic parsers, they already reach 90  - 95% accuracy. There are alot of parsers free for download. Most of them create syntactical trees. They are not very well known. 

Andreas van Cranenburg used them. He wanted to use them to find out wether it was possible to determine by whom the text was writter. Can a computer attribute the author of the text? He used a comprehensive library of five authors. Stylenometry. Before people looked at frequencies of words, which accually yield a good result. Without realising authors use simple structure more often than they want. But looking at simple words doesn't get you as far as you might want. 

Function or content words. He looked both at the flat and deeper patterns. You find indeed recurrant patterns. Combined they give the best result. 

Conrad -> Heart of Darkness. Apocalips now. 

You can even go father. You can also evaluate much larger repositories. Can you predict literary quality. Nobody really knows how literature should be defined, but there are some definitions.

Conlusion: patterns are everywhere, they are ubiquitous in the humanties. As a field they are often looking for patterns, even though they don't call it that. The patterns can often be automatically derifed. 

## The riddle of Literary Quality

Its nearby. Its not possible to create a model. Is it possible. Are there formal aspects. Noadays people agree that quality has  been ascribed to texts trough communciation. Formal elements might influence this communication about a text. How does the first reader determine wether a book is good? 

Do novels that are literary show differences in high and low level patterns when compared with novels which are not? Large online survey. They try to determine a-postriori wheter a novel is good or bad, not define it apriori. They're modeling it to the survey.

Even if you dont know what interpretation means excacly you can go indirectly to it to trough .. .

There is a lot going on in recognising patterns. Combining deep and shallow with the survey and looking wether you can predict new books. DH is often seen as a threat too. People a often worried about it. Complex syntactical structure is often a good measure... but not it completly

## Guest Lecture Digital Hermeneutics - Agora
Term that is still very controversial.

## First speaker

The online museum. The museum is not an imaginairy place. We can think of the web as imaginairy. Monreau. The techniques are also connected the online museum. Large objects are smaller and smaller objects are larger. The angle from of the photo is also important. We are hardly aware of them anymore. They are in other words hermeneutic deviceds. Exploring the online museum is without walls.

The acces to online collections requires a hermeneutic approach. and the conceptualisation of e-humanties. Hermeneutics is a theory of interpretation. Cultural Heratage institutions are concerned with the limitis of automation and modeling on one hand and the interaction of people and technology. Complete automatisation removes interaction. Application as reference work, worthyness of the image, freedom. What interactions are possible. 

The distiction bewtween information and ... Museums could be seen as an iventory of the world. It can also be seen a a place to engage with the world. Communication device. Interaction. 

Online acces to cultural Heritage. 4 Dimensions. information - interpretation, provision - supper, and a few others. An institual wiki can be completely controlled by museum staff. Supporting information could be manual comments, and user tags. Writing a story in a online enviroment adds an interpretation. Might lead to new insights. 

Automating might also be benificial to the museum to create exhitibitions online and offline. distinction beween description erarsion? Metadata is also important searchable. Documentation. Central to the agora project. Facilitate users to make their own storys. Let them decide what the value of an object is. 

Simple even model. Relate objects in museums with events. First step in supporting their interpretation. This does not suffice, relating objects to events. Distinguish between relations of the events. 

For certain objects you can look at the relation to events. The Hermeneutic approach contributes to the field of e-humanties. Patterns found in those data, large scale cultural processes. Starts with the study of cases, people, place, events. This conception of e-humanties museums contribute. Digital Hermeneutics is important to cultural heritage. 

The online museum requires the hermeneutics. 

## Second speaker

Its much about evaluation of whats happening in the digital world. The way people deal with the information. Her is more of a lose discription. How can we create strategies to find deep patterns, laws, predict. Attribute authorship. But how can you create strategies to get to meaning. Its really complex. 

First we need to understand the old traditions. There objects databases like the Rijks. Textual. Or Bibliography. Or Enarctico for painters. Can we combine them? Can we establish meaning then? We do all kinds of things with it then.

### Case study: heated politics. 

They used their physicallity to get their points trough. Something thats not done in our government. Its also more apparant in the Britisch politics. If you compare it with dutch politics. Cool, calm and collected, dull. Is this truly the case? Netherlands is watery, flagmatic persons... Its in our veins to be "nuchter". 17th century. In the 19th century it was also true but for another reason because we just came from a revolutionairy period. This sort of lived on in the 20th century. Rationality. 

There are however many counter arguments for this. De snik van Maxime. The crying dutchman. Was this genuine? Preformance? Are they true emotions? Is there something like emocratie developing? Is it new? How can we research this? How can we research this from different perspectives? Can we find hermeneutic strategies? Heated debate in dutch politics. We have a site where parliamentairy debate is connect to the web. Polimedia 1945-1995. We can search. Every visualisation is a interpretation. The website give the possiblity for event relationship. Krokedillentranen. It's a great repository.

Nederlab.. Were dependant on wether our interface work. What can we do. What can't they do? The're also a limited ammount of queries. You can go from the question to the source. Limited export oppertunities and representation. Sites malfunction. 

You can often go behind the interface. Sparql is an language for this. You can extend your queries. Like to the European Parliament. Do debates about footculture invoke anger? You can think about new kinds of questions. The same you can do for the Delpher site. 

But how do you search for emotions? What are emotions? But if you want to go further? Do you need to think about it yourself? Wordnet Affect is a classification of emotions, feelings, moods, etc. Words are structured in a certain way so that you can catogorise nicely. You can search for positive emotions of negative. It's used on a large scale. But is it helpfull for us? But this is more opinion mining, not emotions. Lots of tools are restricted to social media. Really biased to the 21st century.

Linguistic Inquiry and word count. You have words catagorised in certain ways again. It designed by medical and psychology researchers. They wanted to know wether people were depressed. Completely tested from medical and psychological. 

Bilderdijk is known for his moody behaviour. Financial troubles. Horrible state of live in general. He's complaining bigtime. Yet he's using more positive emotion words that negative ones. Why do we interpret it differently. You can relate it back to events in his life. This is also done for Mozart and Beethoven. Is creativity related to depression or joy. But there is a problem that you're using modern emotion words to analyse the past. Honor for instance is precieved alot different. Also the positive/negative get in our way.

Do it youself is often the solution. Excecuting control. Make your own vocabulairy for emotions. There are no early modern classification of emotions. Classify old emotions ourself. What bodyparts are indicated with them. 

Another example is De Patriotten from Feith. You see a graphical representation of emotions. Researching emotions in plays helps. She is constantly debating her choices. In these political play you see practiscing for the later revolutionairy culture. They are using the models from the theater in the polical debate. Before they where behind closed doors. Now they where in public. You use the models that are there, you can't invent a new one suddenly.

This brings us back to phony and real emotions. Most emotions are acted anyway. The moment you start showing your emotions you're already acting in a certain way. It critises phony emotions as they are phony always.Visualizing emotions. Can we think of new visualisations?

Interpreting and combining patterns. They could give you an indication of what's going on. We can probably have something new to say about the ammount of crying that being done in Dutch Politics.
