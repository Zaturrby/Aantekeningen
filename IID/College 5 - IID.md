## Custodial and Post-Custodial Approaches to Information

Its a challenge to accept a new paradigm. From a archive where you can take custody, to where you cannot. Archives as a place, to archives as concept. There are a lot of changes coming, how do you apply these new concepts. Or how do you rufuse them if they are not applicable. Today the archival profession is much more dynamic now. Everyone knew that documents were already there for a long time, and will be for a long time. Today records are ever changing and might not be there over time. 

## Overview

Terry Cook really started to explore the ever changing record. Archivists were really proud of their neutral position. But this is not so. Every action changes the record, appraisal and description changes them. Objectivity is still debated. You interfere with the natural accumulation of records.

## Records and Archives

### What is a record? 
What is meant by a record. What is information is important in this course. Information as a universe not very well defined. In archival world the record is very clearly defined.

**It has to be a by-product or residue of a practical activity, created by the course of that activity, and set aside for further action or reference.** Everything you do is important because of the activity. Records a different from books in this sense. The goals is to create a book. When you buy a house, you get a record again. They have an administrative or legal purpose. Records have been created to prove or remember stuff. Records can be evidendence for many things. The more they are unconsiensly created, the more they are valuable. They can be valuable in my different contexts. 

Some records are set away for longer periods, because they have cultural value. Some have a shorter record. A receit for a coffee can be records. Evidence for presense in the building, or even sentimental value. To decide what to trow away is very hard. Appraisal. You use the functions or mandate of the company to decide what to keep. But what if they don't have a mandate? What do you do then? How do you define their identity. **Records are process-bound information.** Its bound to the activity.

**They are evidence and memory of transactions. Notions of reliability of authenticity.** You need to be able to prove the record is not changed. The source is important, the chain of custody is important. These concepts are quite different. This is not the place to discuss them. 

**Physical object + network of relationships** In an archive you can still see an object. But they are also a network of relationsships. An archivist must be very carefull in catagorising things. You have to respect to original order, else you destroy the relationships. Today records the links are much more dynamic. However meta-data stores these contexts, it is sometimes missing. If that's the case you need to establish contexts, trough the functions of a company. You look at the form or the records, it reflects the functions. Descriptive tools can reconstruct the order, things dont have to be physically moved. 

**Multiple contexts** 
- The context of creation is the most important **(Juridical, societal, provenancial, procedural, documentary, technological contexts)** All these things are important, you have to know them to be able to know them and to use them. The context of use and reuse is very important too.
- The use / re-use (transactional history) is also very important. There is a chain of people who use a document. A chain of custodians, they use and reuse it.
- Archival custody (classification, retention, appraissal, disposal, transmission, description, acces) Retention is is for judical records easy, its defined by law. Some other records have different values. Transmission is also very important. Every time they move something goes wrong. Records that stay in the same place are authentic. Access is also important, some records need to be restricted, privacy for instance. 

Custody means to take care of, interfere with, the natural segmentation of records. Sedimentation of records. Stratification. Librarians do something different, they chose the order that give the most meaning. Don't interfere. Don't dispose. Archivists are neutral, this was their pride.

Today the thought is that they offcourse interfere. Description gives different meanings. Intentions are added. How do you go about it? Do you have objective tools to work with the records? How can we protect our accountability. By exposing the intent. Describe! Describe! What is the reason for appraisal? Trends? What do historians want? It was close to that aswell. Historical professions changes too. Records can be used for anything. But especially accountability. 

### What are Archives

**The whole of the records made and received by a juridical/physical person or organisation in the conduct of affairs (and preserved).** You also keep the records, else meaningfull information. Archive is defined by Angelsakson definition only for records information for long history. In continental europe its the whole. You have the recordsmanagers and the archivists. In our tradition they are one and the same, in the US they are different. Language is important. Idea's on the other side of the ocean might not be our idea's. 

We talk about post-custodialism. Over the borders, but the concepts we use are still very local. It all looks like one big archive on the web, but its really different. We don't want the record to change, so it's important that archives look different in different places. We talk about cultures later.

**For long archives where a place.** In ancient times they where also stored in a place. Temples for instance. The archivists were the most important people, because they had acces to information. They legitate power. Whatever is in the archive was truth by Justinian law. By the Renaissance they started to study the authenticity of this. Documents proving ownership were abused a little bit too much. Even the pope abused records to claim ownership of lands. Later this became diplomatics. These studies are still valid today, they can be applied to digital records. The distinction of authentic records or not. Today the place is a bit more confusing. But there are still many physical objects. So one paradigm doesnt trow the other out. They are both valuable

**traditional (positivist) paradigm** One of the first archival studies comes from the Netherlands. This manual calls about principles. **It calls for provenace = physical notion (records creators office; 1-1 relationship)** There was one creator of an achive. The organisation structure was stable. You could easily chase the chain of custody. **It was unbroken**.

**Post-modern paradigm** Electonic records break the paradigm. Records cannot be read, or printed in the same way they were used. **provenance = Conceptual notion (both record creators and users functions; multiple relationships** There is no one office or user anymore. Many people read and create the record. There are also many copies. Everytime the document changes it's opened, there is meta-data added? Does that need to be stored. There are many reasons.  Today there are many tools to create relational databases instead of static ones. There is also the ideo of **Diffused custody**. Can an archivist truly manage all information. Archivists need to thrust the system. The post-custiodial is not the post-control, but you need to deal with things like the cloud and stuff. Put rules in the system.

## Other presentation.

Its a shift in thinking. Its an 'ism. The paradigm shifts "from matter to mind". **Its not a technological adjustment, but the replacement of one interpretative framework with another.** Computerssystems often fails because of management systems. They fail though, they manage information, not records. They do not meet the requirements for archivists.What is important is understanding the culture of a company. Sometimes simple tools are more usefull, just creating the right directiories. 

Its a shift in frameworks. **A paradigm shift is a language being replaced by another language.** On type of provenance is replace with another type of provenance. What are the relationships between people. Or servers! What are the relationships between programs! It has to be controlled in someway. 

**Usually the new paradigm is broader of the older one.** It includes the older one. The older paradigm is not gone, there is still authority to be derived from old systems. How to make the new paradigm something you can apply is a challenge.

**Its not a rejection of traditional ideas, but rather a change in empahasis and strategic thinking. A reorientation of the archival enterprise.** You have to find a new way to talk about provenance. The old way is too picky. It needs to be more inclusive. But other things like relationships still need to be preserverd. 

### Information is Changing. 

**The amount of information produced and communicated increases exponentially.**

**Records have changed fundamentally** **Data and information cross boundraries of organisations and jurisdictions** Privacy, laws are different in other countrys. 

**The records may be seen as a process, a concequence of computer instructions.** They have always been about the process. But previously the record could be read independenly of the instruction, today thats impossible. You need to understand the computers. Often meta-data is lost in different technologies. The physical thing is often not the whole record. 

**The record visible on a screen when data are composed and recomposed, and may no longer look the same when place, time and transaction change.** You do not have to become an IT expert, but you need to be able to communicated with them. You need to be able to point out excatly what you need. Without that they don't know what to do either. In the past archivist were very introverted. They were far away from the creators. Today you have to interfere in the politics, you have to be social. Learn how to communicate. You cannot spend all the time understanding the record.

### Records are changing

**Paper records: stored on the same physical carrier and directly visible** 

**Electroninc records are mediated (machine readable) and is also stored in different places** Its even in different systems. Take the weather website. Some data is taken from observatories, some data from other places. The representation of the weathersite is an unique current view? Can you print out the system? You have to be able to preserve the functionality too. We cannot preserve electionic as such. We can only perserve the functionality. Without it you cannot understand it. You have to preserve the ability to understand it as we now do.

### The shift of mindset

**Custodial**
an archive is a collection of physical kept in a building and supervised and controlled by record managers / archivists.

**Post Custodial** SEE SLIDES. It cannot be fixed in time. We have to accept dynamic records.

### Shits in how we conceptualise records and archives

**Archives as an aggregation of doucment -> Recordkeeping system as an information system.** Recordskeeping is a term more inclusive.

**Material object -> Conceptual context**

**Archives -> Act of archiving** A USB stick is not an archive. Some documents have no relationship with each other. They are stored for convenience. But in a computer you have folders to organise it. That is the act of archiving. Do we need documentation? Some say we need this.

**From physical documents (artefacts -> Processes of creation management and use (functions)**

**Cutrating physical documents -> analysing context, intentionality, interrelations, functionality** You have to watch out what you do, there are many unaware changes to the meta data and such. Deletion of a line changes the edit. 

### What is the position of archives. Shifts

- Treasure chambers
- Attractionparks
- Information supermarkets
- Research environments

Many sites that give acces to information are not archives. They just help you with for instance getting to know the history of your family. They are all these things. We need them all, archives need to be usefull to society, they need to be valuable to society.

### shifts in how we position records manegement

**Records management as a supporting process -> Records management as a function integrated in all business processes** People need to be made aware of their archives, they need to know why they have to keep it organised. 

**Records managers manage records -> Records managers are CIOs (Chief Information Officers)**
The could be chief of the information. People have to participate in the buisness life. You have to find a way to get your archive in shape without creating barriers. You cannot ask the recordcreators to replace you. You have to essential.

### Shifts in the professional profile of archivists

**Curators of objects -> Facilitators of "conceptual or virtual interrelationships between creating structures, their animating functions, programmes and activities, the infromationsystems and the resulting records** It the task of the records creator to simplify, it your job to know which records are essential, not to make things more complex.

**Passive gatekeepers -> Active documenters** Disagreement, when you know the record is not there you have to create it. This you could reject. Your not here to document society, society documents itself. You have to be active in being where documents are created to catch them, but not replace the creator. Its a problematic point.

**Researchers of administrative history -> redesigners of business processes** You have to focus of on the present. You have to help redesign the processes because you know them

**Describing ---> Describers of multiple relationships among numerous creators and nemerous series of records**

Electronic Records, Paper Minds

## BREAK

The second reading by Terry Cook. Biting off what you can Chew. 

In Australia they were overwhelmed how to archive the digital. Do not invest or invent! He really tries to provide practical advise. 

There is a lack of physicality of digital records. The logical boundrary. Its also a good reminder that the record is a relationship. Reproduction is also very important. 

Access and preservation do not go hand in hand here. The better you provide access the more you are theatening the authenticity of the object. Even if the technology becomes very sophisticated is that giving acces also gives the possibility to tamper with the record. Everyone with good computerskills can gain access to our systems. Access is good, but there are concequences for the conservation. Preservation mean the perservation of the intellectual properties. Archivists transform wardocuments in PDF or XML, its used to provide a more stable structure that will allow future migrations. But also XML is going to become obsolete. But there are temporary solutions. But this was also the case in the old archives, fires, mices, etc. They do not look the same too.

Current technological solutions (migration, emulation) always involve loss of information. What do you really need to keep? Waht meta-data is important? What are the significant properties? For a contract it doesn't where the date is, but the date may not change everytime you open the document.

Paradigm shift, Records continuum en Post-custodial thinking. The records continuum is a way to look at the record. The opposite is the life cycle model. There is no fixity in the continuum, everyone who accesses the record changes it. There is nog record that is stable. We are reusing, repurposing. When does the record end, or start? When do you appraise the value? When you change computers? As an institution you could only appraise when they went from active to archives. Today it's too expensive to take everything with you.

**Physical integrity != intellectual integrity** Preservation is not conservation. You keep the meaning, the relationship with the function. 

**Perservation starts at the moment of records creation.** You have to imbed in the system the rules to control the record. If you apply it later you may have no record or too many of them. You have to know it from the beginning wether its important. You have to focus of the function. Is it long term, or is temporary?  Will people be interested in it? Is it a transitory record? Or permanent one? Appraisal. To much is going to clutter the archive, conserving everything goes again the archive. Technology allows us to keep everything? For some kinds of research you want everything, for other kinds you want less. Preserving the meaning. Why, what has its use been? You look at it with a special understanding of provenence. What are its connections. 

**the physical locus of preservation is irrelevant** The rules are not irrelevant. The rules and meaning ar still important. Everything is a record. We need everything to understand the context. We have a different focus today. We want to understand the interaction. 

**Everyone is involved!** They are there when they create the record. Intelligent systems that do one thing without interfering with the job. It starts immediatly.

## Terry Cooks - Practical steps

Practical Steps for Archivists to implement Post-Custodial ideas.

- Identify the different organizational environments in which records may reside. The systems world, the world of personal computers. Technologies are stupid. The WWW and specialised applications. Those applications don't think about keeping records, they think about functionality. Archivists need to embed themselfs in those. You have to understand the different environtments to deal with the record. It changes in each of these environments. Know your organisation. 

- Archivist has to act as "an honest broker" within you organisation. Its someone who has no particular interest in the running of the organisation. You are specialised, you know about records. You have to be able to help people. Everyone has een record problem. Scientists etc. Many archivists offer servers. Everyone should know about it. All communities should be concerned with accountability and their records, archivists are experts in this field, and people don't know this. Still the neutral custodian. We don't serve a different interests, just the record. 

- Take a process-oriented approach. People tend to be very repetative. Certain actions are preformed over and over. You have to know this. Its important to see if there is a deviation in thing. If changes in the creation of records happens its important to investigated.

- Move recordkeeping up front. What format? Decide up front. It shoudn't be an uniform decision. It depends. You have to be flexible. You have to tailor make your solution. Record keeping should be moved up front. Selection based on functions.

- Give record creators responsibility (and tools) for the custody of digital material you cannot preserve. The new paradigm encompassed the old. Record keepers cannot decide what is important, they can help. 8-10 procent is valuable records. Its a practical step to communicate and train records creators in helping you to do your job. You could decide the draft of the document are not necessairy. Today it's even more important to involve the records creators. It important to understand.

- You cannot capture the record, but you can capture the system transactions when you cannor capture the record. You want to have the system that creates the process.

- Instead of building specilised recordkeeping systems. You incorperate the functionalities in business systems. You have to build the rules in the the original system.

- Cultures. Information cultures. Analyze and influence existing "information cultures". Cook mentions bad archives. The US army for instance. You can be worried about it for accountability and history. Cook tells the culture is broken. But we have to define what it is. We have to move to a more dynamic culture. In the custodial we believed that we had a strong record keeping culture. We have to follow the processes. We still have paperminds. Some bureaucraties are still following the old. Others are operating smarter. We have to understand the culture and try to find the compromise. To manage the record. Suitable to both the creators and the archivists. Not the bureaucratic guys. The record should not be manipulated. Accountability.

## Small Companies

Don't reinvent the wheel. Don't invest. Just do simple things. Naming conventions for invest. IT people can capture everything in the system. You have an auditor then. Focus on the electronic. Do little steps. Stop being passive and wait for the creator, but go to him.

Don't try understand the processes themselfves, but where the records are created. Somethings in companies are routine, those you can understand. Its doable. Lawyers usually understand accountability.

Will archives be an IT profession. Are they partners? They usually they have no training in achives. You have to use their language. There are however people from IT moving to archives, few, but that was great. It's still a fight, it's because the computer scientists are still in the positivist paradigm. The want to find solutions. Archivists are not looking for problems to solve. Every solution is temporary. Seperate discipline idea is perhaps also absolute. Perhaps it need to be in computer programs, it should be a basic part of the knowledge. They create and rely on it. Everyone should know archives. 










- Awareness
- Enrichment
- Appraisal -> second archive
