# College 2 - Introduction to information and the Digital

## Digitality and its Cosequences

Why talk about the digital? Information and digital should be quite self-evident. We are not really clear about what they are. It appears in all kinds of forms. It assumes that things are different when the word digital is prefixed. There is something special about the medium "digital". What is it?

MIT medialab. Negrepont set it up. He wrote a book "being digital". This quote is from him:
"The methodical movement of .. most information in the from of books, magazines, newspapers, and videocassettes is about to become the instanteous ....... " 

Something from the material moves to the immaterial. This is a common idea about the digital.  Digital is something different, not of this world, not atoms. But in reality digital is much of this world, you'll notice that. It opens up new possibilities. What are these potentialities?

The digital is represented by 0 and 1s. But in fact they're on and off's. But this definition doesn't help that much. The mathematical definitions are really abstract. Even for a programmer its abstract. Lets move away from these premisses: 'Emphemeral / Virtual', 'computational', 'Representational (surrogate)', 'Predestined (progress)'. 

Humanities don't really have to become computational to become digital. Media transfroms and translates, not only represents. The digital also gives a predestined feel. Kittler, Ernst dig trough history how random technology really is. Its also really old, some of the guts havent changed. 

Morsecode. 1840. Developped by Alfred Vail and Morse. Vail came up with the code. Veil came up with the charactercode (and the key), instead of wordcode. Character proved to be more efficient. Is it digital? No. Its quinary. You need a human being to send it, and you need a human to read it. We literally read morsecode. Writing/reading code. But it does have a relation to digitality. For the first time someone said that you could encode characters. There were other froms of telegraphs, but they didn't encode characters.

Babbage calculator. Credited as the predecessor of the computer. 1950's. This is accually a reproduction of the 1970's. This was programmable. It was designed to compute. Is it digital? It's not. It doesn't deal with encoding. Its an analog computer. It uses distances and movement.

Sligrel. Also a calculator. It had three moving parts, you can do quite complicated algoritmatic. It's also quite fast. Calculators are quite young. Late '70's had calculators like bricks. Slide-rule is analog.

Computer. Code-breaking computer 'ENIAC'. This was build to do a few things. To calculate balistic table's. Most of this was for the militairy. It was also doing the code-breaking. What are the ladies doing? The lady's were doing the programmers. The very first programmers where women. 'Roseys' They all had phd's in mathematics. They were rewiring the computers. They build the chips. They got recoginition in the '80ties. Is it digital? No. It was the first programmable, electronic computer. They used transitors, but they didn't use digital encoded information. Analog.

### Baudot's Telegraph

The telegraph, like the key we saw. But this one if from 1874. Its a telegraph too, it send messages. It was mostly used in France and the colonies. It took a while to be more standard. From the turn of the 20th century it became more standard. This is the very first digital device. Baudot's first telegraph. The telegraph used up too many recources. He invented something really interesting, 5 bit digital code. They knew about multiplexing, but interpreting it was hard with Morse code. (6bit acually, but the 6th was a controlcheck). Vietnam movie, telex in the background, this used the Baudot code. ASCII is simply an extention of the Baudot code. Baud-rates from the early modems were named after him. We could write a code that only machines could understand. Is it for computation? No! Its for messages. It started about messages, information, communication.

The key was accurate message transmission. Morsecode. It was inefficiennt, and it needed interpretation, thing needed to be repeated often. This changed with Baudot's code, even unicode uses the same thing. If you look at the digital code for an image, we could never unstand what the image is from the code. Initially people could still read the code, the charactercode could in principle be read. Storage is also really important! Another important thing is that code is the same at both ends. You can have different machines on both ends, as long the machines agree on the code. 

What do we have that does that? Phones, computers, all the machines are different, they use different systems, but they agree on the code. This was a massive advance. Also important was the automatic conversion from code to text. Earyer that had to be done by people. Alot of work simply to send telegrams. This made the media really meaningfull and possible. 

There is something today about digitally that is true today but not then. Computation. Before that the technology was seperate, with different roots. When we do computation on a computer we are in a sense simulating mathematics. Early computers didn't have the accuracy to do complicated math. 

### Punchcards

What was it for? They were used for censuscards, in that use it's used for storage of information. He got the idea in the train, they would buy a ticket in the train and sell it off. So they punched holes in the ticket to identity marks, so that woudn't be possible. 

Back then the problem was processing the information. They used 'computers'. It was a job description. A person. You broke the problem up into logical steps, so that people could solve it. We delegated the process from people to chips. In the mid 19th centrury all computing was done by women. The model for the hydrogenbomb was computed by computers and women, the women were faster, and got it right. They still waited for the computer. 

19 years the cencus was calculated like this. But the computer should be able to do it fast. They used a computer that literally with dials counted up the cencus... It was not digital. It was not binairy. They we're categories that could be added up. 

1911, 1930's company started to come in to being called in the buisness of 'tabuting' with machines. Tabulating machines landed 8 hours after computers in the war. Punchcard we're part of the system. International Buisness Machines... IBM. They worked for allies and the Germans, but that's another story. They we're printing out the information. The cards were summaries. 

Machines to write back to us were needed. Digital encoding. IBM cards. The code already existed, but IBM decided to put in on cards. The IBM-cards. It made conversion to real language easier. In the 40's and 50's computers started get faster. 

Computers started to be developped more regulary, and became faster in the 50's and 60's. They also used harddisks. The disk's could hold half a gigabyte. But both in cards and disk the computer started to use digtal encode.

### Debate

There was a questing about what computers should be: anologue or digital? Anologue was better at computation at the time. Others argues that it should store and process and information? It could store it. The information that comes out of processes could be reused. It could process that. Digital could do that, analogue coudn't. It allowed something else to.. General purpose programming.

A digital computer could store the instruction too. Those didn't have to be hardwired anymore. Then that was radical, but what do you have to be able to do? You have to able to talk to the computer. You have to be able to use language to give instructions not logical structures. You have to be able to communicate you instructions to other programmers. The first programming languages were develloped so that programmers could talk to each others, it had to be converted to assembly. What do you use? Digital encoding of characters. The languages could be pumped into the computers. 

Spencer Tracey and ... ..... It doesn't matter what the plot is too much. We see four actors in the shot. The computer is not a prop! It's an IBM 360. It was part funded by IBM, it's a computer commericial. Embedded a computer in public. Product embedding of a 7 million dollar computer, general computer. Where they calculating mathematics? Where they doing science? Information processing. The computer has comes in to suplement the archivists. It's the first time that people are advertising computer processing, they are advertising information. Digital computers were about information.

From '56 computers are starting to work their way into the universities, companies and governments. People were expermenting with computers. With what they can do. Some people started to come up with idea for education and general public use. Stanford reseachlab. They are showing their inventions. The first mouse...! The second thing is interesing too, keypad. The contempory version of the Baudot keypad. You can directly enter the 5 bit encoding of characters. In the '70 they were already doing windows. What the date on the mother of all demo's 1968. The screenshot is for 1973. Thing don't neccecairily change that fast. They were made faster, but not much change. 

It immediatly become a powerfull medium. Performative. It was very quick. They even though it'll be a good idea to have a laptop. They just didn't have the components to do it small. The dynabyte computer. A quarter of a million for this. It did have an important inpact. In 1979 an enterpreneur saw all this stuff,  Steve Jobs, saw all this and created the mac. The template came from Stanford. What happened later is complex. But almost immediatly when the digital was hooked up with computation devices, all of this took off.

Its about communication. What about digital is important? We know about encoding now. An important part is the copying. If you can't clone two things exactly it all stops working. 

Messages a broken up into packages, bits, and at the other end it has to be excactly the same. Everytime we're working on a computer it stores things. They wanted the laptop to look like a filing system. But it doensn't really do that. It spreads stuff out over the whole drive. In order for us to see it it has to go trough processing. 

A good example of that is painting a digital image. What happens in a digital camera? Alot! The lens, then the colorfilters, then then they go to alot of electronincs. Every single time. The photo's is copied 16 times before we accually see it. The sense of the original doesnt make sense. Alot of copying is happening. Excact duplication is neccecairy. Copies of copies of copies.

In order to do something with these things something has to happen. It has to be processed into something else. The picture we take is not binairy. Everything we look at a picture it has to be processed. We're using the same set of instructions, but the image will be different on different devices. Its based on actual dupication. Constant change. It's never the same. The difference might be trivial, but it's different. 

Digitallity has the neccesity to make copies, multipicity. And the neccesity to compute, processing, preformativity. 

It all started with messages, and that is still what it's about. Its changing also, but the key aspect of the internet is its ability to manage and process text, information. 

## The digital:

1. Binary Encoding of characters, then just about anything and everything. 

2. Needed to be processed

## PAUZE

## HACKERS AND FOUNDERS

Dit gebeurd ook in de werkelijk wereld. Hackers and founders. Its a distributed group. Meetups. 

Introduction: silicon valley, to Amsterdam five years ago. Five years ago there was very little in Amsterdam. Phycally connected to a digital movement. 12 people immersed in digital culture searched online for an offline fellowship. The community started to build slowly.

They started to work on a daily basis. Hip trendy art scene. Programmers wanted to be part of that scene. This is interesting. They were putting time and effort in things, and wanted to creat 'art'. The art of computer programming. Coding can be an esthetic experience. They wanted to be arround other people who felt that way. 

They took the different silo's and created a bigger community. They maxed out the space. What next could be done?

Non-profit organisation. Co-working space in a flipped upside/downside model. They have people who chose to be in the community and have companies. They chose to put money into it to rent spacing. There is also a renting model, where you rent a model. Alot of people are open to new idea's to rent space, with lots of office space being open. The people who own the building on the Herengracht are open to this.

The space is cool, leveraging historical context. It a great building with a great garden? What is cool about it? But there is a way to leverage the space, to spring idea's. Everything is happing in Silicon valley, why not go there? But this wbuilding had a history of a great enterpreneur who build the VOC(?). It's really powerfull. Staying inside the area seems meaningfull.

## X-disciplinary growth.

 The startup scene is getting really rich now. There are people working in old media. But they are struggling, struggling to get talent which are being snatched up by startups. Can we put them in a room with creative people? Programmers arent the greatest in communication, they want to talk about implementation fast.

There was a nice exhibition in the Stedelijk. Beautifull work is starting to come in to being.  

It's an interesting time to start data-mining to tell a story. use software to find a story, not to build only a platform. But there are alot of stories hiding in the data. Is there something interesting happening there?

## Solving relevant online issues with offline initiatives

The community is starting to get big. Initiatives. Web Literacy: What it takes to read write and utilise the web? There are people who understand it, and people who don't? A lot of people don't understand what's happening. They want to start teaching kids about the web. HTML and CSS should be basic skills. 

## Solving geopolitical issues

There is something strange. It looks like the software world in the 1990's in Ukraine. There are contracters and big companies. But you can do alot yourself! Thats is the point of hackers and founders, to make self initiated projects! There is another options.

## Hackers and Founders - speaker 2

Sam Critchley, Spaaza. Small tech community, part of the hackers and founders community. What does spaaza do? Digitalality is a big alement of his background. Literature and Philosopy. He spend alot of time writing letters to friends. As soon as he entered the University he figured out you could email! Speeded up communication!

1996 - UUnet, the first every internet provide in the state. It went independent for the militairy and university. It was growing like crazy. Everyone was hooking things up. It was a crazy time. Set up a pan-european network. He set up a site in Zuid-Oost Amsterdam, where a datacenter was. From there the pan-european network was ran. That was dealing with the package routing. Delivering data from one to the other.

It was indeed very artistic. Data was forwarded from one place to another. There where these layers, almost a organism. The whole of humanities digital activity. It eventually became Verizon.  

He started his own company. You could dial up to a modem. Phones didnt have modem capabilities, but it coudnt do it itself yet. It was clear that is was going to explode. What could you do with that knowledge?

What restaurant, which places? He came up with the app. They rode arround Amsterdam with a GPS. Its in google maps right now? You got a list of what was near you. Gypsy was the first popular  GPS app. It also used the camera. People started picking it up in other country's. Even in China. They used it differently. They took pictures of their food. The chinese also posted pictures of weddings. As a gift they got a staged photoshoot. Eventually the Iphone came. Eventually it became Weibo.

Foursquare was the first popular checkin app. If you checked in the most you became the mayor, and got free stuff. They started to make an app for company's to make promotions targetted. This is another example of digitality.

The original challenge was finding products. You could never find products where in stock nearby. --> Spaaza was born. Pluggin in retailers. They build it and started trying to sell. Consumer apps, they didnt have enough money for that. So they targetted retailers. Quicksilver, also interesting. 

Spaaza is a way to connect retailers with customers. The core is now personalisation. When you're in a shop you look at an app from the retailer. Because you're connected with facebook or others, they can offer you something very personalised. In this case you get a personalised price. It's deployed in the Men at Work stores soon. As you build up cash, you can spend it. It can be plugged in the website of the retailer aswell. It can make your live better as an consumer. The retailers get something too: real time statistics. You can see where it works. These products are selling, and these arent. 

Personalised pricing changes the live of retailers. What they're trying to do is changing the way of retailing. 85% of the retail still happens physically, not online.

If you go far back in time, 1850's. The retailer knew you and things where personalised for you. With mass retail things became much more blunt. There was a huge range of products, and individual shops didnt distiguish themselfs from others. Trying to make the transaction targetted. The shopper gets a better experience and the retailer is also more efficient. 

Other retailers are at the forefront too. Amazon is a big example. Amazon is moving into the local markets. They are blowing away retailers, first on price and products. They outpriced, and had more products. Fresh is getting close at realtime delivery. 

Shut is also a interesting company. If you order online instead of shipping from a big warehouse they use the retailers. A shuttle comes up from a network of cars and brings it to the consumer. Shuttles standerd deliverytime is 90 minutes with a record of 14 minutes. 

Urban Outfitters also combined ecommerce and traditional, and makes it just.. commerce. 

### Hackers and founder

There are 4 teammembers. Mabey 6/7. They are in a building, and cant afford permanent members. But with Hackers and Founders there are individual freelancers, and companies that know the things. Its nice to ask questions. You dont have to post or make official vacatures. Its got a critical mass in the area they are intested in, and got nice renting services. It a nice example of the offline world meeting the online. 

Slack, chat, communication.

## Boast.

Different kind of economy and working practises. We usally thinking of classic technology workflow. Its still there, but it's disappearing fast. There are whole new ways of working, new forms of working. People are talking in terms of buisness, techology, design, social impact, politics, art. We expect this more from the creative industries. People form tech are moving to humanties, and humanties to tech. Boundraries are starting to dissolve.
