# Coding the Humanities

## Break with data-manipulation

Break with bash scripts. Focus on something else. 

Two modes of visualisation
- Exploration -> To get a better idea of your dataset, one to one representation of the dataset. It's easier to look to a chart to the numbers. Better understanding of your dataset. 
- Presentation _> you want to show your data, you want to tell, what's interesting about it? Include or exclude something?

This is not the only way you represented. Excel, html css js, text, csv json. 

What is the appropriate mode of presentation for different kinds of dataset? Is its used for exploration or is it used for presentation. Does it need to communicate with other people? 

One example for the NYT. We'll use it as an example. Exercise that is broken up into parts. Different groups. 

The example breaks with what we know about data visualistation. It doesn't have to be a graph. The NYT leaves some room for interpretation. Filters, selections, but not completly interpreted. Question. Topic in common. They use ankerpoint that are the same and yet unique. Hypothesis. Presumptions, experience. Story links it all togehter. Narrative.

Narratives. What is in the data, but today more about how do we present the data? Twitter data in gephy isn't telling a story. Also the papers we write is a datavisualisation. 

## Assignment

50 years from 2064. For some reason the disciplines we call humanties are gone. More focus on applicable research. We only have the archives. The assignment is: how, given the dataset, can we explain what humanties meant? Mamma, what is humanties? Two parts, front: Question, Topics and keywords and the hypothesis about the dataset. How do I tell a story with data? In order to support your question and hypothesis.
