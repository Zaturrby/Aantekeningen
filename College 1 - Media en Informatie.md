## Introduction to Information and the Digital

## Introduction

What is information? Disclaimer; this is een brand new course.

What is information? Difficult question that seems simple. Overwhelming, we have a lot of it. It should be a simple concept, but what in general does the term refer to? We might not be able to get a definition. 

We could look at etymology. Information Give form to the mind, to discipline, to instruct. For the greeks it was kind, idea, shape, set. Reshaping of our mind. Closer to 'concept'. Information is the content of a message. How do you keep the content transmitted, observation.

But this is very diffirent than our concept of it. Information could be all of this things, but it could also be something diffirent. Something that informs. A kind of understanding, at a certain moment, to solve a specific problem. Information can be many different thing. Its not something that's there, but something thats in a context. Its something cultural, something in a context. Its also political. 

Information is always a anwser to a question. Its also something that's recorded. We can also think about gps, where am I? Where is it? (an allied question) GPS anwsers a question. A lot of work went in GPS, space travel, and other technologies. GPS wasnt the only technology, but one that does it different and perhaps better. It wasnt constructed for us, but for the militairy. Political.

Information here exist in a socialtechnical system. That's the information. We can see that. But there's other times we ask questions that aren't as clear. Who am I? It can be a simple question, but we can mean something different too. We going to give different information. It serves to awnser your question. A name could be considered meta-data. 

Information in the present world is a bit diffirent that the greek and latin. Midieval was dominated by scolastism, gros simplification.  The rise of enlightenment is a good starting point, a lot of institutions rose to adres the problem of information. Library's. There was a shift in the idea of what information did, what it was for. Before it was used to inform people, although it was already collected.  Museums and Library's. They point to thing that we're happening arround the 19th century. Information that has the status of definitive, fits into a large scheme of thing. The more information you organise correctly, the more the grand picture becomes clear. Information becomes something that created understanding. 

Before there was a big idea that people coudnt see correctly. Certainly in the Judea-Christian world, European, the idea that people perceptions were deteriorating. The older the information was, the better it was. That changed. The change was that the information was out there, we just had to collect it. 

We find it hovering arround today hovering arround in large numbers of institutions that organise information. Fileling systems were an invention in the 19th century. Corporations needed to document their operations, but also get a greater understanding. It can purify your live, in some ways it makes your life better. Were in a dialectic between simplification and complexity. Does the computer make your life better. 

---> Reading about the archive on a conceptual level

The context en meaning is often lost. The value of information is often determined by its documentation. It becomes valid, and information in the proces of documentation. Information becomes something we refer to. Because we need more and more information, the problem of that there is too much arises. Organisation becomes more and more inportant. Information deals from that point of view. We'll enrich that point of view later.

Collecting data takes alot of work. 40 years ago that was true. Finding information was hard back then. There were books, but there wasn't a search engine. You had to travel too. Photocopies were rare. It was hard. This is no longer a case. The world has changed quite fundamentally. 2008 - 2013 inaugoration of the pope. Alot of phones in 5 years. A fundamental global change. Its really easy compared to the 30 years in the past. Not everything is easy though.

The other thing that changed was information production was something very institutional. The only mediation were letters, and those were only usable when collected by insitutions. Right now were all archivists. 

Another thing that changed is Google and Facebook. The real value of the archive is what you do with it. Not the information an sich. It had become the new gold. Information is no longer in institutions. It moves greatly now. 

In that world its a recourse for everyone. How do you get the information out. How do you make it work for you? Map of Paris. Hacking phones for OS information. You gave acces to an extrodinairy ammout of power! (compared to the past) The Internet is not just a bunch of wires. We have acces to enourmous processing power for information. Thats another major change. 

How do we think about about, acces, organise and the use of information today. There are alot of new technologies. There are traditions. What can we do with the new technology? How had the digital changed the landscape? How do we engage with the new media? Understand?

## Humanties

What are the humanties. Multiple terms. Alfa wetenschap, geesteswetenschap, humanoira. 

Products or expressions of the human mind. Widely used definitions. The things that humans have made in the world. Music, language, art, literatur, theater. History is between humanities and social sciences. Is it a product of the human mind? They use sources that are products of the human mind. Mathematics is also an expression of the human mind. Interesting thing. Natural sciences study nature, social sciences sciences study people in their environments. 

what is the Digital? Study of the expression of the human mind. Everything that can be represented by discrete, non-continuous values. And can be handled by a computer. Digital is strongly connected to the term data, or digital information or digtial media?

What is Digital Humanities. The study of digital data? information? media? Part of the larger media and information bachalor. But its also part of another tradition. Humanities computing. This was often used. This term feels like two fields, the nature of the term is interdiciplinairy. Computing, finding regularaties, analytial. Humanities, interpretative. 

C. P. Snow. The two cultures debate. If we talk about Shakespeare we assume that everyone knows it. But the second law of thermodynamics is alot less known, but al the more inportant. Culture gap. (no practical application outside the field... ) This needed to be bridged. 

The early days. It started a lot earlyer. In the 40ties. It came from other fields. A theologican wanted to index the works of Thomas of Aquino. In '47 he was told it coudn't be done. Numbers was as of that time the only options. It was too memory consuming. 11 million words. Computers had no memory. He was stuborn enough. They did it in 25 years on punch cards. Nobody uses it anymore, but we have one in the musuem. Punch cards to magnetic storage to modern harddrives. It was the first application of texts in computers. 

In the 1970's was a consolidation of the computing in our discipline. There was not enough computer memory. Iconclass was an example. The informatica of the alfa sciences. It was not interesting from a humanities point of view, they wanted to store and reuse data. There was still no notion of it being a field of its own, it was auxillairy.

With the advent of personal computers things started to change. You could run programs. Much easyer acces to computers. You didn't have to use punchcards, you could do everything yourself. It also stimulated duplication. 

Introduction of the WWW was important. 1994 homepage. 50.000 homepages. Only for academics. Culture Shock. Advertisment with full url was mentioned on billbords. It exploded after that. Major advantage that is was free, hypertextual (links), and it felt that there was no size limit. It developed incrementally. Distributions contributions to same collections.. -> Open Source. Things were stored in diffirent place. 

In the humanties idea's started to arise not only to digitise, but also to use it for other applications.

In the 2000 it started to change even further. The first conferences had a boring name. Digital Humanaties exploded, its about many many things. This new name became quite important. It led to a much wider audience. We didn't have to all learn programming anymore, there were alot of tool available. Broadening of the scope happened. Not only analysation, but also presentation. Critique also came to be, which made it a real field.

It has become so important that it is "the next big thing". IBM and Apple call Digital Humanities the next big thing. Its the next step for the sciences. All this information comes together.  Interpreting art is a major challenge. DH tries to revive the struggle of computers, it really involves humanities now.

## ...

There are a number of odd things. DH is always spoken op in the plural form. Is it a discipline of its own? Its not yet? What are its theories? Is digital Humanities a set of common practices and skills? Everyone had quite diffirent approaches. But there is a commonality. There is a meriad of definitions. (slides). But it's also heavily attacked. Establised researchers  are still following the old ways, and feel that its not that much of a field. 

To what extend can digital humanties produce something its predecessors cannot? If we manage to incorporate do we make ourselves superfluous? Humanities 3.0? Are there problems we can solves that others cannot? There was a long standing problem. Did Hegel know Vegel(?) (italian). He doesn't cite him. There was a bit of a connection with an intermediary. Doing it by hand would take two centurys! The computer does it in minutes. Do we only do it faster? No, we can also ask interesting questions! 

Conceptually distinguish serveral fases. There is humanties 1.0. Interpretation and hermeneutics. Diving into a historic event and interpret it. What has been introduces by the digtal is humanities 2.0. An entire new idea: we do look voor regularities! Not only to the unique. We digitise stuff and can look for new patterns. Positivistic. Everything can be viewed in laws. This was heavily attacked. People digitised and searched for patterns, and did nothing else. They didnt ask why! They didnt use the traditional approach. This is what 3.0 does. Trying to integrate reflection with patterns and technology. You have to know the methods to be able to criticise it. 

Why are we here? (for me to get a conceptual framework arround programming and combining it with computing). Study shown that people are motivated by general iunterest in the digital, aversion to math. Attraction to more gerneral interdisciplinairy work. A third is a mix of pratical and theoretical work. There are several possible reason to study this.

### Challenges
	
There are three reasons why its challenging. Humanities material  is extremely complex! Material can be visual, audio, music, language, text. But much more problematic is that the data is fuzzy. Incomplete, you often just find fragments. Things often have to be assembled from fragments. There are even films missing.

How can a digital approach deal with that? Method en object and presentation can be different. Its often born digital. A painting you have scan and enrich it with metadata. The object itself can be very different.

The method can be digital. Search tools etc. Presentation can be digital. Interactive, non-linear, simulation. Website. etc. Game.

How can this result in new insight? DH scholars use techniques like: Regular expressions, extremely powerfull string searching.  Named Entities ... .etc.

Examples: The Dutch Canal Ring has been digitised, is it intesting? Enartico. Which painting was where. Can provide new insight. New questions can be ansered. Were painting married to publishers more succesfull? The ecartico-database has been worked on for 20 years! You can follow the nachtwacht for instance! Art Historians find it very usefull. 

Musical Similarity app has been critised a bit more. It uses musical similarity models. Using idea's from idea's from musical theory to create something practical. 

Another is political search. Interactive public search system, DH applies to politics. Who said what tho whom and why? these things a written down in the parliament. You can find interesting patterns. How should we interpret this? Is it new?

Emotions in Films. Has been carried out. Searching for emotions in films. You can automaticly detect emotions in films. You don't want to do it by hand. Emotions can be recognised quite well! And can tags films with it. This can also be critised. When they analysed the Mona Lisa it was 80% melancholic. Its alot about critising and interpreting.

## Wrapup

There has been an enourmous influence on the humanities. There are quite alot of changes in object, method and presentation. Yet many are also still in the adhere to older methods too. Do we attribute patterns to data and do they really exist? Combining the digital and the critical. It can also lead to concrete research products.
