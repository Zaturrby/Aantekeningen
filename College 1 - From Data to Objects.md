# From Objects to Data - College 1

Idea behind the course: More digital research. Technical skills not found in the humanties. Using computers for more than just browsing. 

objecttodata.meteor.com/overview.html

## Course Setup / Week by Week

Structure of the course. 

1. Intro
2. Aquiring Data
3. Choosing projects
4. Parsing and Filtering
5. Transforming -> Getting the data into the right shape.
6. Databases and Visualisation
7. Interpretation and Presentations -> how do we look at this traditional humanities practice. 

Assignment:
Every step must be documented. About some interesting research. Automate it.

### Projects

Buidling a portfolio. Constructed database from the NYT, with the word Humanities. API: you can use programming to acces the data. The NYT offers this service. 

Little introduction to the JSON format. A format that is used widely to communicate data. A complex table with data.

What are the interestings things in there? You could look at the representation of the humanities for instance, goes back to 1850. 

Proposal in the beginning of week three. Collaborative projects. 

Grading. Proposal (10%), portfolio(30%) and the final protfolio (60%). Does not fix what you have to do.

Its about collaboration. 

Sort of a recipe. or algoritm. Document the process. 


### Technicalities

Unix commandline. You can chain programs together. Tutorial that can help you out. Getting used to the enviroment. Combining primitives

Get familiar with alot of tools. No graphic interface. If you want to digital tools you need to know what you;re doing. You should understand how your tools work. This is important. You need to be able to back up your claim. Its simple logic. 

- Commandline tools
- Data formats: JSON XML HTML CSV
- Construction data processing pipelines
- scripting

Command Line Crash Course
--> Easy book

## Who's Who?

Introductions

## Digital Humanties

More definitions that people who've heard of it. The basic idea is that humanities are used to the pen and paper, hermeneutics and interpretation. They're alien to technology. Presenting and creating diffirent data-structures. You can do alot of stuff you cant do with a pen and paper. You could do a lot of stuff with pen and paper, one could say, but is tear .. boring. Let's automatise it.

## Objects as Data

Hard to study objects in itself to study. A painting is hard to see as data. But you can look at them holliticly. You could observe them in a larger collection. You could also split them out into frames for a movie.

Objects can be everything, even concepts. Conceptual art. 

Digitised vs. Bord-Digial is a important seperation. Many object can be digitised. A representation in 1's and 0's. Computer knows how to deal with these things. You can observe diffirent groupings of these things. You can loot at it in diffirent levels to analyse this data. 

On the other side you have born-digital. This is the 'original'. Philoshopic discussion. The copy is the same as the original. Does it make sense to talk about the original? Its not always the same though. Not the same transistors represent your object.

### Data

What is data? And object is things given. You can include many things in here. Should you call this course "object to Data" "source to data" "document to data". We're going to look at it liberal. Everything you can represent with data.

It provides a diffirent perspective on humanties subjects. Its not just a digital representation of an object. All the steps and transformation you make are important. Writing is a slow motion way of thinking, that the universities focus on. This is the same. Its very related to thinking. It really helps you understand why. 

### Roles of Data

- focus
- support: I have an argument and want to support it with data. 
- 
- transformations

In a way digital humanties brings in more emperical concepts. Controversial. Show me whay you've done, and i'll critisise it. More of an Hypothesis. It becomes more experimental. You have a question and try alot of things, and you evolve the question. 

Its more measurable. Its quantified. Its made measurable, you can repeat is, in principle it should have the same result. People can look at it, can examine your steps. With this they can critisise better, which is new for some disciplines. 

But it also opens it up to collaboration. Digital research makes it easy to collaborate.

### Examples

Ecartico - Meta data about artists. Its in a database. You can visualise relationships which were hard to visualise before. The idea is that there are statistics about artists. They provide some ways to explore it further. For instance a interactive map.  

There is this idea that Antwerp was more important than Amsterdam. This data visualises that. What shifts in importance are there. But there is still the interpretation of this. Are more painters equals more importance?

- >Nice example to treat objects as data. 


Technological Deteminism. Aquiring Data and Outputting it. Tools arent tailermade. Problem. The person who has the question should have the ability to create suitable tools. Problem is prevalent everywhere, but especially in the humanities. Technically it is deteminism, because the computer is limited. You also learn have to learn how to specify it for programmers.

Is it alot of mapproducing and tables?

Hoe weeg je het the data? the black box that is the computer. 

Does it matter how complete the database is? Also no regular research is complete. But with this research you get the question much more often. The visualisation process is important. Easyer to digest, so easy to see where its lacking. People might also not understand what they see. You don't do the usual source-critisism. But we don't know how to? How do we critically asses this. How do we do source critisism here? Its massive! but complete?? Empirical questions? Empirical critism?

### maping the onymic landscape

Look at the names of novels. The website has reports on lots of stuff. Steps taken. visualisations that are nice. Interesting patterns jump out. 

With anne Kerenina characters alternate. You can find all kinds of interesting patterns. You can see alot of visualisations but you cant read that many books. The're all kinds of errors inside it. In russians names there many variances in names, which makes it harder. 

### Measuring emotions in films 

Narrative transportation in films. They want to combine interviews of people who view a film with face-reader data. How does a computer recognise it in films?

Its works rather well. Connection to interviews is interesting to view if it aligns. 

### Data Critisim

Can the dataset provide realy awnsers? In practise the dataset doesnt awnser the question, so you change the question. What is in the data? What does the source give? What is missing and how important is that? You'll notice it in the NYT dataset. What kinds of questions could you ask?

Size matters! You might look at large scale to get interesting things, but it also limits you 


## Digital vers interpretation. 

All the wonder is still there, its just another way. Also every single step requires interpretation. 

### homework!

Data sets!
Commandline Crash Course.
Interesting: UNIX for poets!


Next week: aquiring data and read Ben Fry. Primitives, what are the things we can do. 

Questing: relationship to quantative and qualative. Probably 50/50.
