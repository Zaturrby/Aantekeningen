## Convergence Culture

What is information? Introduction of data into the world of humanities. We all relate to information and the digital. There is no outside anymore. What if I rent a little cabin up in the woods, disconnect, and just 'be'. First tweet send of the top of  Mnt. Everest. The pervasiveness and ubiquetess of the digital. Everything is already done and told. We've have always interacted with computers this way. It's just more apparent. What does it mean to real human beings. 

We have to consider the consequences. The more pervasiveness and ubiquetness of media, the less we are aware of it. Replication of a study: In this study these people went to three stages of their media awareness. How much time, second stage: diary, third stage: let someone follow you. Most of the time we follow media unaware. Ambient. Media and information have become largely invivisble. 

Are people wo work in the media more aware of it? Professionals? Next to scientists. What's happening in their world of abundance. Rather than giving you a long history, lets use a cultural concept. Something everyone is talking about. This is Convergence Culture. Coined by Henry Jenkins. Primairily sold in the world of media. His theories have become common place. Volkskrant based their new site on it. 

Their was a riot in the filmfestival. The main sponsors got critisism. Distribution of art trough digital services only profit the big companies. 

Deuze Studies the mediaindustry in the US media industry. The research is done by talking to people. One of the key triggers for understanding this is the Matrix. The serie of movies/cartoons, videogames, movies. Started in 1999. Presented a new way to make media in a new media environment. A touchstone upon which many new works are made.

10 years ago a group of at that time phd students noticed that the time of television is over. This is the time of convergence.  In the Matrix especially Morpheus lines are rather hollow, apocaliptic. Jean Beaudriard. Similacra and Simulations. "Welcome to the ... of the real world" - direct quote. There is no real world anymore. Amsterdam is not 'real' to tourists anymore. Beaudriard refused to take part in the movie, there is still a reference to the real world. In Plato's allegorical cave, Nazies is another when it all ends.

Honest movie trailers.
The're is even a tv-spot 10 years later that quotes the matrixs. 

The sender receiver model is obviously trown out of the window. People interact with it in many ways, spoof it, remake it, quote it, etc. There is no such thing as a original anymore. Within convergence culture there is no stable product anymore.

This whole idea of the matrix that socieity is a big computer simulation. As long as we can imagine an outside to the matrix, the matrix isnt ture. All three philosophers consider that the matrix is true, fun to consider. 

## Convergence culture

How do media professionals deal with this world. The world of no stable object. We've seen an example of the matrix. It was a storyworld as Jenkins would say. They didn't come up with a stable object, but a world of objects. In between the movies you should have played the videogames and watched the animatrix. It doenst only happen top down. 

Techno Viking is the prime example of bottom up culture. Edward Rave? filmed people dancing. Did it really happen or was it acted out? 2006. What was the big revolution back then. Youtube started then, it became a global player trough techno viking, which was shared 20 million time. What was it? What is the big deal hear? He stops people from harrasing a young woman. The gesture and the dancing. It got copied alot of times. The original technoviking is now illegal to show, which is weird. 

When we study patterns in behavior in media of DH we attribute it to live things, viral etc. There is a special quality of technoviking. There was a big aha moment. Everyone has access to camera's and nobody has a problem sharing it. Everyone does it, everywhere. This is an important breaktrough. Henry Rolling. He hates techno.

Industry driven converence culture, or bottom up Technoviking. There is no stable object. Objects seem to be alive, viral, evolving, Just like evolution. Coined by Jenkens. A book intended for the media industries. Very critical, or angry discussions. Celebratory, easy to get into. It wasn't written for scholars. Before this his history was in fan studies. 

Spreadable Media a new book, again intended as advices. Creation and consumtion isn't working anymore. Lets make media for reuse. How do you make money. He predicted the social media revolution.  Facebook just started. They are based on sharing and reproducing.

Its not some much we share content made by professionals, but share user generated content. Marketing study shows that UGC is favored above professional generated content. We gotta be mindfull and respectfull to professionals. A Citizen jJurnalist can do the work of a professional. That sucks. Zuckerbergs law, each year people share about twice as much, even if they don't want to. 35 hours of video uploaded to youtube in a minute. 

Martini Media. Waiting for people to consume their own media, your product should be everywhere. "Media thats available when and where you want it with content moving freely between different devices and platforms." Alot still wrong with this definition, content is still quite stable. You can still be doing what you where always doing, the idea of the media. 

Why? did they use martini. "anytime, anyplace, anywhere" song. Campaign for Martini. She was discovered as a model when shopping. Then she was never heard of again. For a brief while she was dating famous people. Simply for being featured in a shot. What happened?  She was famous, and she got a message from an old friend in Beirut. She jumped on a plane to help a friend, she was enslaved in a brothel, untill she got bought for marriage.

### Top down

Convergence Culture: Top Down. In top down conceptualisation we look at the media industry. The anonimous corperate environments. But these aren't really making anymore. They are in the buisness of aquiring. The formed conglomarates in reaction of convergence culture. 6 companies own 90% of what we watch, read and hear. Control is perhaps taking it a bit too far. Vertical integration. All aspects of selling, distributing etc. 

The history of these companies is of spectacular failure. There is as much centralisation as decentralisation. If you look at the top movies and films. Games are an enourmously profitable industry. There are barely original francises. Its an industry to keep doing what they have done before. It plays into what we've done to spoof an interact with. It happens more with francises. 

This happens in the Netherlands aswell. You see a similar process of different companies tieing together on different levels. Uitgevers, omroepen, publishers, advertisers. Paticipating in all media. The top time model is a model of convergence, centralisation. 

Another approach is an industry that use one device for everything. Thrust and believe in one box. If you own a xbox, you can do everything. It's easyer to get money from you. Its a false believe that all of our media experience trough one device. Thing only got more complex. Also the idea that we want to do the same on different devices. Its a knee jerk attempt to control. They are invested in the hardware. 

The way it tells stories -> cross media storytelling. Star was is the first example of it. You tell it in the same way on as many devices. Radia, dvd, itunes, games. Copy and paste on as many platforms. George Lucas didn't want a whole lot of money for it. That made it succesfull. He was widely ambitious. He wanted the rights to everything that happens to Star Wars after the movies were ended. Took his idea from Korea society which is much more integrated. He owned the brand. You get the same storyline over multiple plaforms. In the start he started sueing, but later he allowed it, only if the storyline wasn't harmed. He enlisted the help of fans. Within that space they can do whatever they want.  Top down.

### Bottom Up

Everyone who uses media, creates media. Wall newspapers we all know. When you give people a chance they will rather make that consume. Lecturing is also the worst form of education. People want to do stuff, thats who we are. Fanfiction. Social media is also an example of this. Harry Potter Alliance is also a way to engage people in society, but because it's within the harry potter storyworld they participate. MuggleCase is also an award winning radioshow made by a twelve year old. 

This also has a response in the industry. Crossmedia is still much Martinimedia. We participate, download, etc. Transmedia. We do stuff with our media. This is also forgetting why we use media. Transmedia storytelling, also coined by Jenkins. The first example is the Matrix. There were all kind of alternative storylines. Discussionsboards. The producers also participated in discussions. This was a process where there was the involvements of multiple media, people were being taken serious. It made the process much more messy. You have to get alot more work to get to everything. You want to do more with your story. You share.

In fact this year for the first time, a student got his PHD on transmedia journalism. This is being talked of right now. 

2007 2008 examples. The possibilty of industry driven media development. How could viral marketing work? The blair witch project. It was aired on True Blood. Vampires live side by side with normal humans. Vampires and Zombies are pretty much the same, aside from the face that one is more attractive. They made a hype for a episode. Could way of intergrating all media.

Art is Resistance, global conspericy. People were arrested, people found usb sticks under their seats. It was a reaction to police control of the US. Year 0. In 2007 a fractured snapshot was released. People started to react in the real world. alot of  participation. We will not only consume but also create. 

On the one hand is the creative challenge, and on the other side the conundrum that professionals want to create a stable object.  They have to think about collaborations and that is hard, it challenges your self worth.

## Journalism

Making massive francises is the most likely way the industry is going to react. A third of media professionals have lost their jobs. The money doesn't go the the creators of art, it goes to distributers and advertisers. Professionals also feel that they are competing with their audiences. 

If you type journalism in Google image search one of the first pictures you see is of a old journalist with alot of objects. Its cross-medial always. CNN even advertises to be a Citizen Journalist. It's part of how the concern operates now. Hive, swarm, viral. biological. In pictures this also happens, biological is mixed with technological. Contact lensen with camera's have a patent filed.

Telegraaf also has a project where websites are ran by a single editor, 

Brown Mosus. He is unemployed. He follow youtube channels. Right now he is the most thrusted reporter. Every party in the Syria conflict has a media department. An unemployed blogger is one of the most reputable journalist. People like this have also existed, but the interesting way is how he's incorperated in the system right now. Bellingcat, got overinvested. You cannot only have fun with music, but also with Journalism. Its a breaking with the traditional world.
